- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nandhakumar
- I graduated in 2021, and now, in 2024, I am working in the billing section of an oil company. Although I have been there for one year and six months, I still feel that I lack knowledge about my work. I completed only one degree and regret not studying more during my career gap. I aspire to restart my life by transitioning to a career in development. While I have little to no knowledge of programming or development, I am confident that I can learn. However, I'm uncertain about which specific area to pursue, as I don't have any technical skills or experience. At 25, it feels like Iâ€™m starting from scratch. I am determined to develop into the amazing person I know I can be. I would greatly appreciate guidance on how to embark on this journey. Thank you!
  
  STAY HEALTHY, TRUST YOUR PROCESS, NEVER LOOK PAST OR FUTURE JUST LIVE ON THE PRESENT,BE HAPPY, DO LOVE YOUR JOURNEY ON YOUR LIFE, NEVER STOP LEARNING
